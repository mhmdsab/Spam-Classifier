# Spam-Classifier

spam_classifier.ipynb

Bi-directional LSTM spam classifier model trained on dataset of about 5000 mail.
The model uses trained embeddings using fasttext library that forms the embedding using skipgram method.
The notebook a step by step illustration to how fasttext is used to train embeddings and how to use these embbedings 
in a keras embedding layer.
